                        FORMATMW Program

The FORMATMW program formats, verifies and tests hard disk drives 
that are connected to a Morrow Designs Hard Disk DMA controller.

Usage:

	formatmw drive-type [arguments]

where  drive-type  is  a required name that describes  the  drive 
being formatted.  Possible drive-types and arguments follow:

Optional arguments:


drive #		   Specify   a   physical  drive  (0-3)   to   be 
                   formatted.  Default is drive 0.

head  # 	   Specify a physical head to be  formatted.   By 
                   default,  all  the  heads  are  formatted  and 
                   tested.   If  you  want to check out one  head 
                   only,  include  this  argument.   Consult  the 
                   manufacturer's  manual for the allowable  head 
                   numbers.

nosoft		   When  this flag is specified then soft  errors 
                   that occure during formatting or testing  will 
                   be  reported but not added to the bad spot map 
                   being  built.   This flag is  used  primarilly 
                   during  drive evaluation and allows CP/M  test 
                   programs  to  get a shot at marginal  sectors.  
                   This flag may also be used when the the drives 
                   bad spot map overflows.  Eg.  Entries will not 
                   be "wasted" on soft errors.

size #		   Specify  the  sector size.   Legal values  are 
                   128,  256, 512, 1024, and 2048 bytes.  Default 
                   is  1024 bytes.   Note:  Users of  the  Morrow 
                   Designs multi-user operating system, Micronix, 
                   are  required  to format their disks with  512 
                   byte sectors.

skew #             Specify   the  skewing  factor  to  be   used.  
                   Default is 3.  A skew factor of 6 is suggested 
                   for Micronix.

test		   Invoke  a  disk test  routine.   This  routine 
                   writes  various patterns on the disk and  then 
                   verifies them.

track #		   Specify  a particular cylinder to be formatted 
                   and  tested.  Consult with the  manufacturer's 
                   specifications for legal cylinder values.

Any combination of optional arguments can be combined for various 
affects.  

Common command usage includes:


    A>formatmw m5

formats drive 0 for a CP/M environment.


    A>formatmw m16 drive 2 size 512 skew 6

formats drive 2 for a UNIX environment.
