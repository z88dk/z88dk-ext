Abstract: CURVE FITTING WITH CUBIC SPLINES
------------------------------------------

	A rigorous development of the mathematical theory of cubic
splines and their use in curve fitting in two and three dimensions.
Emphasis is on the implementation of efficent computer algorithms to
calculate coefficients of both nonperiodic and periodic splines using
Gaussian Elimination and sparse matrix representations. Accompanying
program listing presents C source code for a full emulation of the UNIX
(registered trademark Bell Laboratories) SPLINE curve interpolation
utlity.

========================================================================



    Before computer-aided drafting workstations completely replace the
draftsman's pencil and paper, let's examine one of his tools: the
spline. Presented with data in the form of points on an x-y plane, the
draftsman will use a spline - a flexible strip of metal or plastic - to
draw a smooth curve between them.

    The technique is very simple. After plotting the data on a sheet of
paper, an appropriately sized spline is held in place at these points
(referred to as "knots") with weights or pins. The draftsman then traces
the curve formed by the spline. For any given set of knots, the curve
generated is independent of the spline chosen, and is thus exactly
reproducible.

    From mechanical engineering, elementary beam theory shows that if
the spline is not too severely stressed, it will conform to a curve
described by a set of cubic polynomial equations, one between each pair
of adjacent knots. Adjacent polynomials meet at their common endpoints
(the knots), and their slopes and rates of curvature at these points are
equal. Stated in mathematical terms, these polynomials join continuously
at the knots with continuous first and second derivatives.

    Knowing this, we can develop a mathematical model of the draftsman's
splines, and from this model construct a computer program for
interpolating a smooth curve between a set of knots. With a bit of
care in choosing algorithms, such a program can quickly and accurately
generate a curve for a thousand or more data points on the smallest of
personal computers. It can even be adapted to interpolate a smooth
surface between points plotted in three dimensions.

    Developing the model involves basic calculus and matrix theory. If
you are unfamiliar with such mathematics, rest assured that the
resultant algorithms are very easy to program, and using a cubic spline
program requires no understanding of the underlying mathematical theory.
Give the program a set of knots and it will dutifully interpolate a
smooth curve in all (well, almost) cases.

    Why then discuss the mathematics of cubic splines at all? There are
two answers. One is that seeing how the algorithms are developed gives
you the confidence to use them. The other is that there may be cases
where the algorithms will not perform exactly as desired. Knowing their
theory may enable you to create a modified algorithm to fit the problem
at hand.

A Simple Explanation
--------------------

    Whether you understand calculus and matrices or not, it helps to
have in mind a mental image of what you are trying to accomplish. Even
if you aren't comfortable with the mathematics, a conceptual model will
serve to illustrate the principles involved.

    A cubic polynomial equation is nothing more than a simple algebraic
equation of the form:

              3     2
        y = ax  + bx  + cx + d

where a,b,c and d are constants. If you plot the knots on a grid and
actually bend a draftsman's spline to fit between them, each section of
the spline between adjacent knots can be matched by a curve generated
by the above equation ... if the appropriate constants are chosen. The
trick is to find those constants for each section of the spline.

    Common sense says three things about these curves. One is that they
should join at the knots. Next, the slopes of the curves should be the
same where they join. Third, the curvature of the curves where the join
should be the same. The first is obvious - the curves must form a
continuous line. The second and third are more intuitive, but a few
moments thought should convince you. A semirigid object such as a
spline does not permit abrupt changes in angle or curvature as it is
bent around a rigid pin.

    Stating these ideas mathematically will enable you to calculate the
constants for all the cubic polynomial equations needed to model the
spline.

A Rigorous Explanation
----------------------

    Beginning in this section, the mathematical theory of cubic splines
will be rigorously developed. If this approach does not appeal to you,
simply skim the text for the information on how to implement the spline
algorithms, then examine the accompanying program listing. The program
header provides all the information you will need to use the program.

    Starting with a set of data points (the knots) stated as horizontal
coordinates x[i] (i = 1,...,n) and corresponding vertical coordinates
y[i], the curve-to-be is defined as the composite function:

	y(x) = f[i](x) for x[i] <= x < x[i+1], i = 1,...,n-2
        	       and x[n-1] <= x <= x[n]

where each function f[i](x) is a cubic polynomial as described above.
In other words, y(x) is really a set of functions, each of which is
defined over an interval between two adjacent knots at (x[i],y[i]) and
(x[i+1],y[i+1]).

    Furthermore, let's define y'[i] and y"[i] as the first and second
derivatives of y(x) at x = x[i]. Knowing that the set of functions
f[i](x) must join at their endpoints (the knots of the spline) and also
that their first and second derivatives are continuous at these points,
we have the following continuity conditions:

	f[i](x[i]) = y[i]		i = 1,...,n-1
	f[i-1](x[i]) = y[i]		i = 2,...,n
	f'[i-1](x[i]) = f'[i](x[i])	i = 2,...,n-1
	f"[i-1](x[i]) = f"[i](x[i])	i = 2,...,n-1

    Since each function f[i](x) is a cubic polynomial, it follows that
its second derivative is a linear function (a straight line) between its
endpoints. If we define:

	h[i] = x[i+1] - x[i]

then linear interpolation gives us:

		   y"[i] * (x[i+1] - x) + y"[i+1] * (x - x[i])
	f"[i](x) = -------------------------------------------
				     h[i]

    Integrating this equation twice and selecting the constants of
integration such that the continuity conditions are satisfied, we can
derive the following interpolation equation:

		  y[i] * (x[i+1] - x) + y[i+1] * (x - x[i])
	f[i](x) = ----------------------------------------- -
				   h[i]

		      2  +-	   +-
		  h[i]	 |	   | (x[i+1] - x)
		  ---- * | y"[i] * |------------- -
		   6	 |	   |    h[i]
			 +-	   +-

		  +-	      -+ 3 -+		   +-
		  | x[i+1] - x |    |		   | (x - x[i])
		  | ---------- |    | +  y"[i+1] * | ---------- -
		  |    h[i]    |    |		   |   h[i]
		  +-	      -+   -+		   +-

		  +-	    -+ 3 -+  -+
		  | x - x[i] |	  |   |
		  | -------- |	  |   |
		  |   h[i]   |	  |   |
		  +-	    -+	 -+  -+

	for i = 1,...,n-1

			 Interpolation Equation
			 ----------------------

    Remember this equation - we will later use it to interpolate the
curve defined by y(x) between the given knots. However, we first need to
calculate the unknown coefficients y"[i] for all i between 1 and n.

    Differentiating and evaluating the above equation for x[i] yields:

		      y[i+1] - y[i]   h[i]
	f'[i](x[i]) = ------------- - ---- * (2 * y"[i] + y"[i+1])
			  h[i]	       6
and
			y[i] - y[i-1]	h[i-1]
	f'[i-1](x[i]) =	------------- + ------ * (y"[i-1] + 2 * y"[i])
			    h[i-1]	  6

    Since the first derivatives of the functions at their endpoints are
continuous, these two equations are equivalent. We can rearrange the
terms of their right-hand sides to get:

	h[i-1] * y"[i-1] + 2 * (h[i-1] + h[i]) * y"[i] + h[i] * y"[i+1]

	      +-			     -+
	      | y[i+1] - y[i]   y[i] - y[i-1] |
	= 6 * | ------------- - ------------- |
	      |	    h[i]	    h[i-1]    |
	      +-			     -+

	for i = 2,...,n-1

    Expressed in matrix form, the above equations show an interesting
diagonal symmetry that we will later take good advantage of. Using n = 6
as an example, they look like this:

+-			       -++-     -+   +-    -+
| h[1] c[2] h[2] 0    0    0    || y"[1] | = | d[2] |
| 0    h[2] c[3] h[3] 0    0    || y"[2] |   | d[3] |
| 0    0    h[3] c[4] h[4] 0    || y"[3] |   | d[4] |
| 0    0    0    h[4] c[5] h[5] || y"[4] |   | d[5] |
+-			       -+| y"[5] |   +-    -+
				 | y"[6] |
				 +-     -+

where c[i] = 2 * (h[i-1] + h[i])

		 +-				-+
		 | y[i+1] - y[i]   y[i] - y[i-1] |
and   d[i] = 6 * | ------------- - ------------- |
		 |    h[i]	      h[i-1]	 |
		 +-				-+

A Variety Of End Conditions
---------------------------

    So far, we have n unknowns y"[i], but only n-2 conditions as
expressed by the above equations. Two more conditions are required to
obtain a unique solution for our curve y(x). Several variations are
possible; we will look at two of the more useful ones here.

    The first is to specify that:

	y"[1] = j * y"[2] and y"[n] = k * y"[n-1]

where j and k are arbitrary constants. With a bit of matrix
manipulation, we get:

+-					  -++-       -+   +-      -+
| c[2]  h[2]  0     ....    0       0      || y"[2]   | = | d[2]   |
| h[2]  c[3]  h[3]  ....    0       0      || y"[3]   |   | d[3]   |
| 0     h[3]  c[4]  ....    0       0      || y"[4]   |   | d[4]   |
| ....  ....  ....  ....    ....    ....   || .....   |   | ....   |
| 0     0     ....  h[n-3]  c[n-2]  h[n-2] || y"[n-2] |   | d[n-2] |
| 0     0     ....  0       h[n-2]  c[n-1] || y"[n-1] |   | d[n-1] |
+-					  -++-       -+   +-      -+

where c[2] = (2 + j) * h[1] + 2 * h[2]
      c[i] = 2 * (h[i-1] + h[i]), i = 3,...,n-2
      c[n-1] = 2 * h[n-2] + (2 + k) * h[n-1]

		 +-				-+
	         | y[i+1] - y[i]   y[i] - y[i-1] |
      d[i] = 6 * | ------------- - ------------- | , i = 2,...,n-1
		 |     h[i]	      h[i-1]	 |
		 +-				-+

    If the values of j and k are zero, we have y"[1] = y"[n] = 0. This
is equivalent to a spline whose ends are not constrained beyond the end
knots, and is known as the "natural" cubic spline. A nonzero value for j
or k is equivalent to bending an end of the draftsman's spline, and will
affect all of the interior cubic polynomial functions. However, the
effect on the interior polynomials rapidly decreases as one moves away
from the endpoints.

    For some sets of knots, a nonzero value of j or k will result in a
smoother interpolating curve at its corresponding end. A value of 0.5 is
often appropriate. Be forewarned, however, that for some negative values
the curve will be discontinuous. As it approaches these values, the end
of the curve begins to oscillate, the peaks becoming larger and larger
until they reach infinity at the exact values.

    The above set of linear equations can be solved using Gaussian
Elimination. However, we must be careful. In its most general form, this
method can require prodigious amounts of memory and millions of floating
point computations. Given 1000 unknowns, Gaussian Elimination needs
storage for over one million floating point numbers and performs some
334 million multiplications and divisions! The loss of accuracy due to
so many calculations can render the results meaningless.

    Fortunately, our coefficient matrix is very sparse and symmetrical.
The non-zero elements can be stored in a few linear arrays, and the
remainder ignored. By observing how Gaussian Elimination solves the
equations, we can modify the method to eliminate operations involving
multiplication by and addition of zero. The result is Algorithm 1, which
has very reasonable memory requirements and execution times - a cubic
spline problem with 1,000 knots can be quickly solved on most personal
computers, even those with less than 64K of memory!

---------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm 1: Nonperiodic Spline Coefficient Determination
---------------------------------------------------------

/* Reduce matrix to upper triangular form */

for i = 2 to i = n-2
  begin
    c[i+1] = c[i+1] - h[i] * h[i]/c[i]
    d[i+1] = d[i+1] - d[i] * h[i]/c[i]
  end

/* Solve using back substitution */

y"[n-1] = d[n-1]/c[n-1]
for i = n-2 to i = 2
  begin
    y"[i] = (d[i] - h[i] * y"[i+1])/c[i]
  end

y"[1] = j * y"[2]	/* End conditions */
y"[n] = k * y"[n-1]

---------------------------------------------------------

    In practice, array y"[] would initially be used to store the
elements of array d[]. Then, as the elements of y"[] are solved during
back substitution, they overlay the values of d[]. To implement this
space saving technique in the above algorithm, change every instance of
d[] to y"[].

    The second variation is more interesting, and comes from the need to
interpolate data extracted from periodic phenomenon. If we plot any
periodic data in polar co-ordinates, a smooth curve between them forms a
closed curve, with the endpoints of the curve meeting. Plotting the same
data in rectilinear co-ordinates with the abscissae expressed over 360
degrees, it's easy to see that we can model the curve with a cubic
spline function.

    Since the curve is periodic, the endpoint ordinates are by
definition equal. In other words, y[1] = y[n]. We need to specify the
end conditions such that the first and second derivatives of the curve
are continuous with respect to each other at these points. Stated in
mathematical terms, y'[1] = y'[n] and y"[1] = y"[n].

    The second derivatives are easy - they can be expressed directly in
matrix form. To utilize the first derivatives of y(x) at the end points,
we need an equation that relates them to y(x) and its second derivative.
Going back to our derivations for f'[i](x[i]) and f'[i-1](x[i]), and
evaluating them for x[1] and x[n] respectively, we have:

		      y[2] - y[1]   h[1]
	f'[1](x[1]) = ----------- - ---- * (2 * y"[1] + y"[2])
			  h[1]	     6
and
			y[n] - y[n-1]	h[n-1]
	f'[n-1](x[n]) = ------------- + ------ * (y"[n-1] + 2 * y"[n])
			   h[n-1]	  6

But y'[1] = y'[n], so that

	    +-				 -+
	    | y[2] - y[1]   y[n] - y[n-1] |
	6 * | ----------- - ------------- | =
	    |	 h[1]	       h[n-1]	  |
	    +-				 -+

	h[n-1] * (y"[n-1] + 2 * y"[n]) + h[1] * (2 * y"[1] + y"[2])

    Again with some matrix manipulation, we get:

+-					  -++-       -+   +-      -+
| c[2]  h[2]  0     ....    0       h[1]   || y"[2]   | = | d[2]   |
| h[2]  c[3]  h[3]  ....    0       0      || y"[3]   |   | d[3]   |
| 0     h[3]  c[4]  ....    0       0      || y"[4]   |   | d[4]   |
| ....  ....  ....  ....    ....    ....   || .....   |   | ....   |
| 0     0     ....  h[n-2]  c[n-1]  h[n-1] || y"[n-1] |   | d[n-1] |
| h[1]  0     ....  0       h[n-1]  c[n]   || y"[n]   |   | d[n]   |
+-					  -++-       -+   +-      -+

where c[i] = 2 * (h[i-1] + h[i]), i = 2,...,n-1
      c[n] = 2 * (h[1] + h[n-1])

		 +-				-+
		 | y[i+1] - y[i]   y[i] - y[i-1] |
      d[i] = 6 * | ------------- - ------------- | , i = 2,...,n-1
		 |     h[i]	      h[i-1]	 |
		 +-				-+

		 +-			      -+
		 | y[2] - y[1]   y[n] - y[n-1] |
      d[n] = 6 * | ----------- - ------------- |
		 |    h[1]	   h[n-1]      |
		 +-			      -+

    These equations can be solved efficiently and quickly with another
modified version of Gaussian Elimination:

------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm 2: Periodic Spline Coefficient Determination
------------------------------------------------------

/* Initialize array e[] as nth column of matrix M[][] */

e[2] = h[1]
for i = 3 to i = n-2
  begin
    e[i] = 0
  end
e[n-1] = h[n-1]
e[n] = c[n]

/* Initialize variable f as matrix element M[n][1] */

f = h[1]

/* Reduce matrix to upper triangular form */

for i = 2 to i = n-2
  begin
    c[i+1] = c[i+1] - h[i] * h[i]/c[i]
    d[i+1] = d[i+1] - d[i] * h[i]/c[i]
    e[i+1] = e[i+1] - e[i] * h[i]/c[i]
    d[n] = d[n] - d[i] * f/c[i]
    e[n] = e[n] - e[i] * f/c[i]
    f = -f * h[i]/c[i]	/* Now matrix element M[n][i] */
  end
  f = f + h[n-1]  /* Now matrix element M[n][n-1] */
  d[n] = d[n] - d[n-1] * f/c[n-1]
  e[n] = e[n] - e[n-1] * f/c[n-1]

/* Solve using back substitution */

y"[n] = d[n]/e[n]
y"[n-1] = (d[n-1] - e[n-1] * y"[n])/c[n-1]
for i = n-2 to i = 2
  begin
    y"[i] = (d[i] - h[i] * y"[i+1] - e[i] * y"[n])/c[i]
  end

y"[1] = y"[n] /* End condition */

-------------------------------------------------------

    Other end conditions are possible. For example, you can specify the
slope of the spline at its endpoints by specifying the first derivatives
at y[1] and y[n]. You can also specify a linear combination of first and
second derivatives at the endpoints. However, the two examples presented
here will generally prove the most useful for interpolative curve
fitting.

    Specifying the end conditions and solving the appropriate set of
linear equations gives us the coefficients we need to solve our
interpolation equation. (Note that this equation remains the same no
matter what end conditions have been specified.) For any given value of
x within the range of abscissae spanned by the knots, we need only
determine the two knots between whose abscissae the value lies. This
gives us the value of i to insert in the interpolation equation, and with
it the appropriate coefficients y"[i] and y"[i+1] to use in solving for
the curve's corresponding ordinate y.

    What about the related problem of fitting a smooth surface to data
plotted in three dimensions? Well, if the data is regularly spaced in
two of those dimensions (say the x-y plane), we can calculate a family
of curves in parallel x-z planes. Each curve is the intersection of the
x-z plane with the surface. Then, for any perpendicular y-z plane, our
knots are the intersection of the x-z plane curves with the y-z plane.
From these, we can calculate the intersection of our surface with the
y-z plane. With this method, we can uniquely determine any point on the
surface.

Final Words
-----------

    Demonstrating the above algorithms could have been done using a
small BASIC program. However, the UNIX operating system (see reference
4) offers a utility called SPLINE that is much more comprehensive.
Heeding once again Richard Stallman's (The GNU Manifesto - DDJ Mar.'85)
call for placing UNIX in the public domain (FGREP - DDJ Sept.'85 was my
previous response), the accompanying "demonstration" program is a full
emulation of the UNIX SPLINE utility.

    Cubic splines are an elegant solution to the problem of fitting
curves to a set of given points in an x-y plane. A understanding of the
mathematics used to develop them is not essential. The simplicity and
efficiency of the algorithms involved should encourage anyone interested
in graphics or data analysis to add cubic splines to their software
toolboxes.
