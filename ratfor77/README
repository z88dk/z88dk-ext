===============================================================

This is a C version of ratfor, derived from a UofA ratfor
	in ratfor. It was originally released to the net sometime
	ago, and It is re-released for the benefit of those sites
	who only get mod->comp.sources.

	It now includes minor changes to produce F77 code as well.

	This code *is* PD. You (public) have all the rights to the code.
	[But this also means you (singular) do not have any *extra*
	rights to the code, hence it is impossible for you to restrict
	the use and distribution of this code in any way.]

	I would, as usual, appreciate hearing about bug fixes and
	improvements.
