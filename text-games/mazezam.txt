MazezaM - a puzzle game

Introduction:
=============
MazezaM (pronounced "may-zam") is a simple puzzle game. You enter the
mazezam on the left and you have to get to the exit on the right by
pushing rows of blocks left and right.

This is the CP/M version. It is intended for the VT52 terminal console.
Type: "terminal vt52", in MYZ80 emulator to switch to the correct mode.
In the game = represents a brick, # represents a block, P is the Player
and O is a door. Good Luck.
If the VT52 terminal is not set, the game will not display properly!


To the best of my knowledge MazezaM's specific game logic is original. 
Unfortunately, there are so many puzzles out there that it is impossible for
me to be sure. If you are aware of a prior instance of the idea, please get
in touch. If possible, include a link which I can add to my web page.

The idea for MazezaM came to me while recalling an Oric-1 type-in game
called "Fall Guy" (from the book "Sixty Programs for the Oric-1" by Robert
Erskine, Humphrey Walwyn, Paul Stanley and Michael Bews). The game play is a
reminiscent of the game Sokoban (Thinking Rabbit, Inc) and also bears a
resemblance to "sliding block" or "sliding piece" puzzles where wooden shapes
are moved around in order to get a (usually larger) shape from one side of the
puzzle to the other. The name "MazezaM" was suggested by Robert Byrne.


New Levels Wanted:
==================
If you like this game and are good at designing levels, I encourage you to
create levels and send them to any of the authors for include  in  further
versions. Credit of course will be given.
